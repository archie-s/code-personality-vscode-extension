# Code Personality Themes

A VS Code extension that automatically switches your editor theme based on your coding activity and stress level. Experience a dynamic workspace that adapts to your flow!
You can find it on VS Code: jarchie - Code Personality

## Features

Code Personality Themes intelligently switches between three distinct themes based on your coding behavior:

- Calm Mode: Activated when you're idle for 20+ seconds - a soothing theme for when you're thinking or taking a break
- Focus Mode: Activated during active coding sessions - optimized for concentration and productivity
- Panic Mode: Activated when you have 5+ errors in your code - helps you identify that you need to slow down and fix issues

### How It Works

The extension monitors:
- **Your typing activity**: Detects typing bursts (12+ edits in 10 seconds) to trigger Focus mode
- **Your idle time**: Switches to Calm mode after 20 seconds of inactivity
- **Your diagnostics**: Counts errors and warnings across all files to trigger Panic mode
- **Error resolution**: Immediately switches back to Focus or Calm mode when errors are fixed

### Intelligent Switching

- Switches happen **immediately** when errors are detected or fixed
- Smart cooldown (15 seconds) prevents excessive theme switching during normal transitions
- Panic recovery bypasses cooldown for instant feedback when you fix your errors

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.108.1 or higher
